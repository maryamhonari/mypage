I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at [Unity Technologies](https://unity.com/products/machine-learning-agents) contributing to [ML-agents toolkit](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents). My focus is on leveraging Reinforcement and imitation learning to training intelligent agents, including providing a user-friendly package for state of the art methods and maintaining an open source project.

I received my Master's degree degree under supervision of [Dr. Alona Fyshe](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~alona/) from Computer Science Department University of Victoria where I studied Natural language processing (NLP), machine learning and their applications to understand language composition in human brain.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
